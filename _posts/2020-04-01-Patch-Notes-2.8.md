# Patch notes for 2.8

## Changes:

+ **Added Easter Holiday Theme / Event**
    - During April, the Easter Holiday will be active in-game
    - Brand new Easter theme, art credit **[LaFite](https://twitter.com/sarahmavrelis){:target="_blank"}**
    - An Easter Egg Hunt - Find all the eggs and double their bonus! Idea and art credit **[DimiFW](https://twitter.com/Dimifw){:target="_blank"}**
    - A dozen or so new items, not all Easter exclusive, art credit **[DimiFW](https://twitter.com/Dimifw){:target="_blank"}**
    - Brand new bugs, tell us all about them!
+ Re-branded the T-Rex to Ð-Rex
+ Updated some incorrect description strings
+ **Wash your hands**
+ Might have made some alterations to certain variables if the date is April 1st
    - Some might have noticed an increase in certain activities
    - There will be an increase of certain activities for the duration of this holiday, although with less crime than today
+ Changed save file ending to .DOGE, previously .LZ
    - You can still upload .LZ files, it's really just a change of filename for more wow
    - If you're curious, I chose .LZ originally due to the name of the compression library
+ Fixed missing pew pew's for the shotgun
    - We live in a society
+ Balance updates
    - Altered drop rates and stats to favor slightly more loot with lower stats in general
    - Pickaxe DPS is unaltered from the previous change
+ Pushed back how early you can get access to the D.I.A. mission
    - Somewhat. I'm not telling
+ Added the requested names submitted by [Patrons](https://patreon.com/dogeminer){:target="_blank"}
+ Updated a couple of supporting libraries (HowlerJS and mobile-detect.js)
+ Fixed some new-found time-travel bugs where multiple cars would appear and the buttons never show
    - *There is one known bug with time-travel: If you have Fast Travel on (in settings) and do two missions where you hit SKIP, the second one most likely won't show the buttons. A temporary fix is to press SKIP to show them :)*
+ Accidentally made the shop display the absolute wrong DPS for all helpers
    - Upgrades remained unaffected
    - Should be all good now, though
    - There was another bug as well, but you had to have the Holiday Theme turned off
    - Luckily, with the aid of a friendly Shibe, we fixed it, yay us
+ There were at least two more people I was going to credit

Also,

+ I swallowed a bug
+ This is the first Easter Holiday version
    - The plan is to add more content before April is over and even more features for next year
    - Definitely more backgrounds
    - Things do not usually go as planned
    - There was going to be a big April Fools feature, but then I barely made the update in time for April, bar a few bugs to fix, which took up the rest of the time available
    - At least we have a thousand ideas for next year :D
+ Certain new parts of the phone and tablet modes remain untested
    - These parts are visual in nature and should not cause malfunction, if they are problematic at all
    - I do not advice anyone to use the phone layout without using a phone, or faking the use of a phone
    - There are probably some bugs with using different modes when on the "wrong" device (e.g. phone and desktop layout = stop right there, criminal scum!)
