title: Running a little late, more videos, patreon?
---
## The deadline won't be hit this week, instead expect the release next week.

After going through what's left, I filled up the entire week with work, so a release this week is not likely to happen. Instead, I'll work the week and try my hardest to get it ready for testing by Friday, then run a bunch of tests with some friends and see if it runs good and isn't too weirdly balanced.

**Expect the next update next week instead.** _By the way, by gaming standards this is more of a DLC than an update, but only one company does those well AFAIK, so lets stick with update, as DLC has a bit of a negative ring to it or an expectation that it would cost money._

### More Videos?

Gathering the votes from last weeks poll about having more cutscenes for the other launches, we have a strong yes (>90%). You've been heard. After the update, one of the priorities I'll work on is switching out the current video system for a youtube embed _(should work on more devices - we had about ~80% success rate with the current system which isn't good enough)_ and then start doing more launch videos (skippable by choice). Sound good? Good!

#### Have you seen an ad on the blog?

Because I haven't. They're not supposed to be more than 1 or 2 in total, but I don't think they work. Has to do with this now being an AMP only blog, but still, annoying as it is my only income for this project. Oh well, a cleaner experience for the read is also nice.

I've been reading up on **affiliate marketing** as an addition as well as **patreon**, but I have no idea where to start - or if I _event want a patreon_ for a single project like this (time consuming as it is...). **Would you sub to a patreon by me?** _What would you expect to get as a patron?_ I just made a strawpoll for this so you won't have to type if you don't want to: [strawpoll link, easy to answer, pls click.](https://www.strawpoll.me/16267742){:target="about_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}

**Reading this and got thoughts for me?** Hit me up _(apart from the disqus comment section below (anonymous commenting works) I recommend you either tweet me, email me (see footer) or send a facebook PM (also in footer))._

Thanks!

**Alright, enough procrastinating by writing posts, rkn!** Time to dive into spaghetti code and make a stew _(right after I post this to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DogeMiner/){:target="about_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"})_, **TTYL**
