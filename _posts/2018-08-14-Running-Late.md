title: Running a little late, more videos, patreon?
---
## The deadline won't be hit this week, instead expect the release next week.

After going through what's left, I filled up the entire week with work, so a release this week is not likely to happen. Instead, I'll work the week and try my hardest to get it ready for testing by Friday, then run a bunch of tests with some friends and see if it runs good and isn't too weirdly balanced.

**Expect the next update next week instead.** _By the way, by gaming standards this is more of a DLC than an update, but only one company does those well AFAIK, so lets stick with update, as DLC has a bit of a negative ring to it or an expectation that it would cost money._

### More Videos?

Gathering the votes from [last weeks poll](https://twitter.com/rkn_dev/status/1029267245124472833){:target="_blank"} ([the strawpoll](https://www.strawpoll.me/16250574/r){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}) about having more cutscenes for the other launches, we have a strong yes (94%+). You've been heard. After the update, one of the priorities I'll work on is switching out the current video system for a youtube embed _(should work on more devices - we had about ~80% success rate with the current system which isn't good enough)_ and then start doing more launch videos (skippable by choice). Sound good? Good!

#### Have you seen an ad on the blog?

Because I haven't. They're not supposed to be more than 1 or 2 in total, but I don't think they work. Has to do with this now being an AMP only blog, but still, annoying as it is my only income for this project. Oh well, a cleaner experience for the read is also nice.

I've been reading up on **affiliate marketing** as an addition as well as **patreon**, but I have no idea where to start - or if I _event want a patreon_ for a single project like this (time consuming as it is...). 

##### Would you sub to a Patreon if I make one?

_What would you expect to get as a patron?_

I have an idea where patrons could, for example, make fortunes for the game (with other patrons voting to have some sort of quality control maybe), after which they can be added to the game. Also patrons could help decide/vote for the future development of the game. It might be a start. If I decide to do this, I'll do tons of brainstorming to make sure that patrons get decent content and unique ways to influence the game. Since I'm not sure if this is a good way to go, I made a poll for it (another poll, yay!): [Link to strawpoll about dogeminer patreon](https://www.strawpoll.me/16267742){:target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

**Reading this and got thoughts for me?** Hit me up _(apart from the disqus comment section below (anonymous commenting works) I recommend you either tweet me, email me (see footer) or send a facebook PM (also in footer))._

Thanks!

**Alright, enough procrastinating by writing posts, rkn!** Time to dive into spaghetti code and make a stew _(right after I post this to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DogeMiner/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"})_, **TTYL**
