#### Setting up the dev blog now, no fancy looks yet, priorities...

Using some new tools for the first time. Hold my pickaxe.

This blog is currently not a priority (the next update is with the mission and Titan you know), but if/when I'm bored I'll make it look better.

It's more likely I'll post stuff to the blog rather than improve its looks (it is amazingly usable in its current default state, thanks to jekyll & jekyllnow).
