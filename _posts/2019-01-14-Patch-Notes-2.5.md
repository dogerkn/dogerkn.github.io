# Patch notes for 2.5a (Auto-Loot beta)

<amp-img width="290" height="165" alt="The Auto-Loot Option" src="/assets/images/autoloot.jpg"></amp-img>


This is a short post detailing the changes recently uploaded. 

## Changes:

+ Added Auto-Loot option in settings
    - _This option is unlocked after one mission or from timeline #2_
    - _At the moment it will automatically equip new pickaxes that are auto-looted_
    - _In the next patch, I intend to finish the new Settings design, which will give more space (on all devices), so that's when an Auto-Equip option can be available_
+ **Big** change to the **value** algorithm for rocks, clouds, etc
    - _It now uses parts of your current DPS to determine the value_
    - _These values are subject to change based on your feedback. Testing indicates decent values so far, but you guys are my bestest testers_
    - _This was done because increased DPS after prestige was causing boring gameplay, especially early on_
    - _If appropriate, +DPS could be brought back to Super Fortunes, but for now we will do without and see how it runs_
+ In addition: rocks (etc) no longer have a chance to drop loot boxes when at more than 50%
    - _I think most will agree that getting up to 5 boxes from 1 rock with high +Loot Find and +Luck stats was a bit too much_
+ The game will no longer automatically travel when you purchase the rockets if you have done so before
    - _For example, you can now buy the Space Rocket without it automatically sending you to The Moon if you are on another timeline than the first_
+ Added a chance to do more than 2.5x damage if your +Critical chance is over 100%
    - _I think it works_
+ 99% of everyone was playing with the "Rock UI" on (showing the % left), so that option has been removed to save space
    - _Want it back? Let me know and I'll put it in the new settings_
+ Added an option on the front page to use more compressed textures (less pretty) if your internet is known to be slow
    - _Additional tools like this planned_
+ Added a new MAX performance option that will reduce graphical complexity
    - _This is still a work in progress and there is much more that it could improve_
+ I think performance was reduced slightly in this patch, **please let me know if the game suddenly runs a lot worse for you**

I believe that was most of the changes in this patch.

Note that this is a _very new patch_ that has been _tested very fast_ and there may be new bugs to fix. _Let me know_ if you happen upon any and if you can, give as many details as possible (device, browser - even errors in the console when the bug occurred, if any and if possible on your device. An image of either the bug itself or the console error also helps a lot). 

### Regarding +DPS change in last patch:

First of all, thanks to everyone who voted! Only 6 of you picked the crazy option.

About one third voted against removing +DPS from Super Fortunes, which tells me that quite a few wanted to keep it, but more were fine with losing it, in favor of a more balanced approach.

We'll see if the new rock and loot changes in this patch would allow +DPS to come back to Super Fortunes, but I think it would be too OP still (and especially in the long run), but I might be wrong.

Oh and if you load the game and suddenly your timelines don't show and it pops up stuff you have already seen: refresh the game and it should be good again. This happened randomly to me only a few times, so I'm still working on the reason.

And lastly: Have fun!
_Unless the game became completely broken, then tell me_
