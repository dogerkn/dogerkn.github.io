title: The Moon Launch Video, AMP:ed up blog & more cutscenes?
---
## Let's watch it together in all of its 30 seconds of glory. Then perhaps you could take a moment and answer a simple question!

I've reuploaded the launch video in it's original format (4:3 heh), please spend your valuable time watching this beauty (again?) and feel inspired for more:

<amp-youtube
data-param-rel="0"
    data-videoid="tUFnqPPVavE"
    layout="responsive"
    width="560" height="315"></amp-youtube>
    
_On that note, for those of you who have played this game a lot (say gone to Mars and possibly further), you might have noticed a lack of cutscenes. Would you like to see more scenes like this for the other launches as well?_

### I've made a poll on twitter again:

<amp-twitter width="375"
  height="472"
  layout="responsive"
  data-tweetid="1028195274542534656">
</amp-twitter>

As well as on [strawpoll](http://www.strawpoll.me/16250574){:target="_blank"} for those who don't use twitter (you really should because then you can follow me).

#### We're AMPed up now!

Did you notice a speed difference on the blog? Probably mostly noticeable on mobile but, it's now **100% [AMP](https://www.ampproject.org/){:rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} verified!** Much yay. This might improve our luck in Google searches in the future.

_(It only took about 10 hours of valuable, precious development time that I could've spent on the game. I have no idea if it'll be worth it, but since I had never done anything AMP-related before I sort-of just started playing around with it and couldn't finish until I got it working (this is how most of my learning takes place).)_

**I promise I'll focus more on the game now.** _Deadline week is looking bleak (it rhymes!), I'm guessing 80% risk of missing it by a couple of days._ Had some extra input and functionality/improvements that needed to be made, as well as some real life distractions, but enough excuses - there is work to be done. Bye for now.
