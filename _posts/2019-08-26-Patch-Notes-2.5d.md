# Patch notes for 2.5d ("Micropatch")

*This is a small-ish patch that won't make a ton of difference on the outside, most of the changes are behind the scenes or simply changes to certain strings or descriptions.*


## Changes:

+ Pickaxes should no longer explode
+ String changes to helpers & upgrades
    - _You can no longer purchase a "shit-ton" of Mars Bases (a heckin' lot of bases is enough)_
    - _While High Quality Pussy was great, due to possible misconceptions, that specific upgrade will now give Pussycats higher quality instead_
    - _Added a dozen additional phrases here and there_
+ Earth is now round to appeal to a larger audience
    - _I deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused to all Flat Earth shibes_
+ Cost/balance changes
    - _Lowered the initial cost of the DogeStar_
    - _The "Sensor Package" upgrade now acts as an upgrade rather than a downgrade_
    - _Very minor changes in a few spots_
+ The main coins counters are now displayed with a faster bitmap version of the font
    - _This is a bit technical but it should improve performance in rendering, as the text/numbers are updated very frequently compared to everything else_
+ Kittens have reduced their appetite for human flesh
+ Added links to the awesome [Dogeminer Discord](https://discord.gg/PBg9yb4){:target="_blank"}
+ Added a link to the new [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/Dogeminer){:target="_blank"} if ad-blocking is detected
    - _The Dogeminer Patreon is new and still in the works, later it should become more visible - probably added to the sidebar by the social links_

Initial work on a few new features has also been done, but won't be noticed or available in this update as they are still being worked on - for now I'll just say that they are wow. 

A bunch of bugs remain unsquashed (if you have reported them before, fear not - I most likely still have it on the todo list!). Most of the bugs _should_ be visual in nature, or has to do with the cloud saves not working on all platforms - this specific one most-likely won't be changed soon, it should be replaced by a different system.

Some minor alterations are bound to be unlisted, due to the inherent memory loss nature over time in human brains. Hopefully a future update will correct this issue, but for now it's out of my hands.

_As per usual, if the game has become completely broken, let me know (first try refreshing the page, that usually solves minor hiccups)!_
