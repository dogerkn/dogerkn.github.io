title: Setting Deadlines

## Is easy.

*Hitting them is the hard part.* So far my estimates (from 2014 to now) has always been way off. I can't see the entire picture all at once, so my brain makes an estimation. Somehow I always underestimate the time it will take.

However, deadlines are very good to set for several reasons, not only for you (the players), but also for me - as an *external motivator*.

*My coach/mentor/friend told me to set a deadline, so I looked at the calendar and just threw something out. Even if I miss it, I'll be close by the time I do so.*

So without further ado...

**The current deadline for the next big release is:**

## The week between the *13th and the 19th* of August.

*I've kept the deadline as a week because you never know. Mark it in your calendar. Follow the social media pages. Cheer me on, etcetera.*

That's about a month away from today (July 17th). I've set up the "to do" notes that need to be done by then (there were way more than I thought, and some are way boring bugs, but alas...).

**PSA from the last post:** I've seen a few people restart the game because they got bored after getting pretty much everything. Don't do it now, everything you accumulate will improve your mission rewards (items, coins, helpers) - the rewards come in the form of dogediamonds (lots of them depending on your current status) and one of three DIA badges that you get to choose (+Luck, +Wow or +Loot Find). The badge will be more powerful the more of something you have (I'm not telling).

Here's a picture I took of the moon with my phone and some binoculars, which is completely off topic but makes the page less of a wall of text, also I'm a little proud... that it's almost a good picture.

*The mission is done by the way*, except for the phone details of course (making things smaller, moving them a bit, that sort of stuff). Don't worry I've got a post-it for it. Luckily, most of you (since release) play via PC or Tablet (<5% phone users, go you!). *The Phone version needs to keep up though, especially as I get closer to turning this thing into an app (!),* but I feel it's been far from perfect from the start and I might want to improve upon it *more than I have time to do before this release*.

Anyhoot, I've set notifications on my phone to tell me when I'm 25%, 50%, 75% and even 100% close to the deadline. This will, at the very least, let me know if I'm on the right track or if I'm seriously lagging behind (and need to get off my ass). Wish me luck, fellow shibes.

*I said this in the previous post but if you've got any good advertising opportunities, youtubers, idk, let me know. Either in the comments or email (rkn@dogeminer.se).*

**Social media shotout until this blog has some share buttons and stuff:**

Subscribe to [the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DogeMiner/){:target="_blank"} if you use reddit, or follow me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/rknDA1337){:target="_blank"}. The [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/dogeminer/){:target="_blank"} also exists and should I get the dogeminer dev stuff on snapchat, instagram, youtube? Patreon? (I barely survive rn) I wish there were more of you reading this so I could do a poll, but I'll do so something akin to that in the future on the bigger mediums I have available then :-)

#### Thanks for reading and have a great day! Here's to hoping I can hit the deadline!

*Let me know what you think in the comments below (if they don't show up you're probably blocking them with an extension or something, it's just a normal disqus integration, you can turn them (adblockers/privacy extensions) off for this blog if so, it doesn't track you (anonymous IP's and stuff like that for analytics), also there's minimal ads anyway)*
