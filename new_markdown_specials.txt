## VALIDATING AMP PAGES!

Google AMP adds built-in validation logic to make sure your pages follow all the rules so they render as fast as possible.

To check your page, just add #development=1 to any url on your site and then check the javascript console in your browser.

http://localhost:4000/#development=1


## Making Google serve your page
Google will cache valid AMP pages if you link to them with one of these urls:

https://cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/<your page url here>

Or:

https://amp.gstatic.com/c/s/<your page url here>

DONT do this until page is done! They dont refresh often

## Required Schema Data
To actually get your page featured in Google search results,
it needs to include a http://schema.org NewsArticle schema.
See _includes/metadata.json for the version generated by default. You might want to tweak it.

Syntax highlighting can be used with triple backticks, like so:

```javascript
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
```

Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  

Finally, horizontal lines
